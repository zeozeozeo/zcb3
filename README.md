# ClickpackDB

A collection of 400+ clickpacks sourced from the [ZCB Discord](https://discord.com/invite/b4kBQyXYZT), accessible from within ZCB.

  <kbd>Clickpack</kbd> > <kbd>Open ClickpackDB…</kbd>

# Clickpack format

ZCB supports AAC, ADPCM, AIFF, ALAC, CAF, FLAC, MKV, MP1, MP2, MP3, MP4, OGG, Vorbis, WAV, and WebM audio files. (thanks to [Symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia))

### Clickpack folder

A clickpack can have `player1`, `player2`, `left1`, `right1`, `left2` and `right2` folders (the last 4 corresponding to platformer left/right directions), which can have `hardclicks`, `hardreleases`, `clicks`, `releases`, `softclicks`, `softreleases`, `microclicks` and `microreleases` folders inside of them (which may have audio files in them). All of the folders are optional, and you don't have to record clicks for both players (but clicks will sound more realistic if you do).

### Noise files

The `noise.*` file can also be named `whitenoise.*` and it can be also be located in the `player1` or `player2` folder. The clickbot prefers the root clickpack directory rather than player1/player2 folders to search for this file.

# Commandline arguments

To see commandline arguments in your terminal, run `zcb --help`

If you run without any arguments, the GUI will start.

# TODO

- Translate to other languages
- Progress bar for rendering audio and loading clickpacks

# Building

To build, clone the repository (or download zip and extract) and run `cargo build` for debug builds and `cargo build --release` for release builds.

# Donations

ZCB is completely free software. Donations are welcome! :D

By donating you'll get a custom role on the Discord server (dm me) and early access to some of my future mods.
